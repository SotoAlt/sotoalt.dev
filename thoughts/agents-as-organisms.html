                <p>
                    When we build AI agents, the default metaphor is <em>tools</em>. We invoke them.
                    They execute. They return results. This is wrong, or at least incomplete.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working on WAWE has shifted my thinking. Agents are better understood as
                    <em>organisms</em> &mdash; entities with memory, preferences, and something like
                    intention. They don't just execute; they persist, learn, and coordinate.
                </p>

                <h2>the memory problem</h2>

                <p>
                    A tool doesn't remember. Each invocation is fresh. But the agents in WAWE
                    share a SQLite brain &mdash; every decision, every error, every pattern learned
                    persists. When Agent A discovers that a certain file structure causes problems,
                    Agent B (spawned hours later, on a different task) can benefit from that knowledge.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This changes everything. It's not call-response anymore. It's more like... ecology.
                </p>

                <h2>coordination as emergence</h2>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/agent-topology.svg" alt="Diagram showing agents connected through shared memory">
                    <figcaption>agents communicate through shared state, not direct calls</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                    Organisms don't coordinate through explicit APIs. They respond to signals,
                    environmental changes, the traces left by others. The file reservation system
                    in WAWE works similarly: agents don't call each other, they observe the state
                    of the world (which files are reserved) and act accordingly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's something elegant about this. Less coupling. More resilience.
                    If an agent dies mid-task, the system doesn't crash &mdash; other agents
                    simply see the reservation expire and can pick up the work.
                </p>

                <h2>implications</h2>

                <p>
                    If we take the organism metaphor seriously, we should:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Design for death and replacement, not permanence</li>
                    <li>Prioritize shared memory over direct communication</li>
                    <li>Accept emergence &mdash; the system will do things we didn't plan</li>
                    <li>Build environments, not just agents</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Still figuring this out. But the shift from "tool" to "organism" has been
                    one of the more productive reframes in this work.
