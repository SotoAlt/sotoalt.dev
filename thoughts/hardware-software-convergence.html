                    Building Amiwo &mdash; a personal UV and air quality sensor &mdash; has been
                    a lesson in the strange space where atoms meet bits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Software people often underestimate hardware. Hardware people often
                    underestimate software. Both are wrong. The convergence zone is where
                    interesting things happen.
                </p>

                <h2>atoms are slow, bits are fast</h2>

                <p>
                    In software, iteration is free. Deploy, measure, fix, deploy again.
                    The cycle can be hours or minutes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In hardware, iteration costs. Each PCB revision takes weeks. Each
                    enclosure redesign needs new molds. You learn to think more carefully
                    before committing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This constraint is frustrating but valuable. It forces <em>design</em> &mdash;
                    actual upfront thinking about what you're building and why.
                </p>

                <h2>the BLE dance</h2>

                <p>
                    Bluetooth Low Energy is the bridge between Amiwo's hardware and the phone app.
                    It's a protocol designed by committee, full of edge cases and gotchas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Getting reliable connections across different phones, OS versions, and
                    environmental conditions is harder than any backend I've built. The
                    wireless medium is hostile. Packets disappear. Connections drop. You
                    build resilience or fail.
                </p>

                <h2>making invisible forces visible</h2>

                <p>
                    The philosophical goal of Amiwo is <em>visibility</em>. UV radiation is
                    invisible. Air quality is invisible. But they affect us constantly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The device takes these hidden forces and makes them legible. A number.
                    A color. A notification. Suddenly you can respond to what you couldn't
                    perceive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's something almost esoteric about this. Making the invisible visible.
                    Isn't that what all measurement does? What science does?
                </p>

                <h2>lessons so far</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Start with the sensor, not the form factor</li>
                    <li>BLE reliability > BLE features</li>
                    <li>Test with real users in real conditions early</li>
                    <li>The enclosure matters more than you think</li>
                    <li>Power budget is the hidden constraint</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Still building. Still learning.
