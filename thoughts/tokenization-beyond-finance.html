                <h1>tokenization beyond finance</h1>
                <p class="meta">2024.10 &middot; 4 min</p>
            </header>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The crypto world talks about tokenization primarily as a financial
                    mechanism. Tokenize real estate. Tokenize stocks. Tokenize art.
                    Turn illiquid assets into tradeable tokens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is fine, but it's a limited view. Tokenization is more fundamentally
                    about <em>creating handles for things</em>. And that's useful far beyond finance.
                </p>

                <h2>handles and references</h2>

                <p>
                    A token is just a reference &mdash; a unique identifier that points to something
                    else. File descriptors are tokens. URLs are tokens. Pointers are tokens.
                    The token itself is cheap and movable; the thing it references may be heavy
                    and stationary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What blockchains add is: immutable, decentralized, globally-readable reference
                    systems. Anyone can create a reference. Anyone can verify it. No central
                    authority controls the namespace.
                </p>

                <h2>tellura and physical tokens</h2>

                <p>
                    This is why <em>Tellura</em> interests me. We're not just making copper tradeable
                    (it already is, on commodity exchanges). We're creating a <strong>handle</strong>
                    to physical copper that can exist in software systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A copper warrant token can:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Be used as collateral in DeFi protocols</li>
                    <li>Be fractionalized (own 0.1% of a copper warrant)</li>
                    <li>Trigger automated actions when conditions are met</li>
                    <li>Be composed with other tokens in novel ways</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    None of this requires the copper to move. The token is a handle; the handle
                    enables composition.
                </p>

                <h2>beyond assets</h2>

                <p>
                    What else could benefit from decentralized, verifiable handles?
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identity claims</strong> &mdash; "I am over 18" without revealing who you are</li>
                    <li><strong>Credentials</strong> &mdash; verifiable proof you completed something</li>
                    <li><strong>Permissions</strong> &mdash; transferable access rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Commitments</strong> &mdash; cryptographic promises that can be verified</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The pattern is: take something that currently requires trust or a central
                    authority, create a token, and suddenly it can participate in trustless,
                    composable systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is early. The tooling is rough. But the design space is vast.
