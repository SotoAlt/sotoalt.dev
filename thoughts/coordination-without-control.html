                    Most systems assume coordination requires control. A central server. A master
                    process. A coordinator node. But some of the most robust systems coordinate
                    without any central authority.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Git is peer-to-peer. Bitcoin has no master node. Ant colonies have no CEO.
                    These systems achieve coordination through <em>protocol</em>, not hierarchy.

                <h2>stigmergy revisited</h2>

                <p>
                    Ants coordinate by modifying their environment. One ant leaves a pheromone
                    trail; another follows it; the trail gets stronger. No ant tells another
                    what to do. The environment <strong>is</strong> the communication channel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In software terms: the database is the message bus. You don't call other
                    services &mdash; you write to shared state and let others react.
                </p>

                <h2>WAWE and environmental coordination</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the model behind WAWE's agent coordination. Agents don't call each
                    other. They read from and write to a shared SQLite database. File reservations,
                    task queues, learnings &mdash; all stored in the environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Agent A reserves a file, Agent B simply <em>sees</em> the reservation
                    (by querying the database) and acts accordingly. No direct communication
                    needed. If Agent A crashes, the reservation eventually expires. The system
                    heals itself.
                </p>

                <h2>the tradeoffs</h2>

                <p>
                    This approach isn't always better. You lose:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate feedback (you poll instead of push)</li>
                    <li>Strong consistency (eventual consistency is the norm)</li>
                    <li>Debugging clarity (no call stack, just state changes)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    But you gain:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Resilience (no single point of failure)</li>
                    <li>Flexibility (add new agents without changing existing ones)</li>
                    <li>Simplicity (each agent is independent)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Not every system should work this way. But when building systems that need
                    to be robust and evolvable, it's worth considering: can we coordinate through
                    environment rather than control?
