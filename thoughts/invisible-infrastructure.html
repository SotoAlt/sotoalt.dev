                    The best infrastructure is invisible. You don't think about DNS until it
                    fails. You don't notice the power grid until the lights go out. This
                    invisibility is a feature, not a bug.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But there's a cost to invisibility: we stop understanding how things work.
                    We become dependent on systems we can't see, can't fix, can't even describe.
                </p>

                <h2>the amiwo problem</h2>

                <p>
                    This is why I'm building <em>Amiwo</em>. Air quality affects us constantly &mdash;
                    our mood, cognition, sleep, health. Yet we can't see it. The infrastructure
                    of the air around us is entirely invisible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it visible changes behavior. A number on a screen creates awareness.
                    Awareness creates action. The invisible becomes actionable.
                </p>

                <h2>a design principle</h2>

                <p>
                    When building systems, consider: should this be invisible? Sometimes yes.
                    The user shouldn't care how your authentication works. But sometimes the
                    answer is no &mdash; making a system visible gives users agency.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Show the loading state, not just the result</li>
                    <li>Expose the process, not just the outcome</li>
                    <li>Make the invisible visible when visibility enables action</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Infrastructure should be invisible when it's working. But we should always
                    have a way to see it when we need to.
