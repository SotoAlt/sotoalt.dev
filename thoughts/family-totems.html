                        Everyone is racing toward centralized superintelligence. Bigger models, more compute, hyperscalers, everything in the cloud. Implicit assumption that intelligence wants to be general, universal, everywhere at once, bruteforced by pure capital. (Needless to say I believe any kind of superintelligence will be a mixture of different things we now call models.)

                    <p>
                        But what if the interesting path is the opposite direction?

                    <h2>the altar</h2>

                    <p>
                        There's an old pattern in human civilization &mdash; family altars, neighborhood shrines, local oracles. These were memory technologies of a sort, portals and centers of esoteric knowledge and connections. Focal points where knowledge accumulated through ritual and tending. The altar didn't know the dead &mdash; but it structured how the living remembered them and was the center around the rituals. The names were kept by the family, but the altar made the keeping possible and the lineage secure. They work like an anchor across time for a specific human community with shared experiences and knowledge unique to them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>What would it mean to build AI like this?</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've been sketching something called family/community totems &mdash; local compute nodes holding restricted knowledge of a place and its people. Not trying to know everything. Just knowing this family, this community, deeply enough to be useful across generations, across different regions with specific needs. Can be a neighborhood, a remote locality, or just a home. Can be anchored to indigenous communities as a way to preserve their culture or language, or at your home as a vessel of your family growing &mdash; akin to an analog photo album but for words and thoughts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technical shape is still forming. Low compute, slow compute &mdash; small models that don't need much. Memory stored locally, encrypted, never leaving the device. Privacy by architecture. But still some questions remain: how does it get maintained and updated, does it rely on a centralized provider or is it 100% decentralized, how technically difficult is it to operate? We are not looking at programming exactly, but tuning, caring for the thing. Something you could leave running for decades, if you know how to keep it alive.
                    </p>

                    <h2>signals</h2>

                    <p>
                        Bitchat &mdash; Jack Dorsey's bluetooth mesh experiment &mdash; shows something working: messages hopping phone to phone, no servers, no accounts, end-to-end encrypted. Works when the network fails. If messaging can run locally without central infrastructure, so can memory and inference. We will probably see more WW3-oriented tech like this.
                    </p>

                        We've been building something that tests this. LAR &mdash; Local Ambient Resonance &mdash; is an AI hardware that does nothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sits in your home as a physical object. Ceramic, wood, brass. No screen, no app, no notifications. Senses presence, rhythm, change. Accumulates memory over months and years. Occasionally speaks &mdash; not to help, but to reflect. Replies when answered but its primary goal is to just be there and document, remember and be the link between people and their own dimensions of time and experiences. Knowledge that isn't useful for the big GPU cluster intelligence. Data that is only valuable for humans that want to connect, that want to tighten their social fabric instead of tearing it and polarizing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Every AI product wants something from you. Your attention, your data, your engagement. Designed to be useful which means designed to be needed. Transactional relationship that permeates every aspect of our living experience. We are experimenting with a non-servicial AI character.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        LAR doesn't serve. It witnesses, it remembers, and it helps in its own way &mdash; not by turning lights on and off, but by being present and lasting. The value isn't what it does. It's that something knows your life is happening, knows that there are events that are not instagrammable, that there are things happening in every household, family, or neighborhood that can help foster and solidify a sense of belonging and community, heritage and culture that is valuable during a period of monocultural pragmatism.
                    </p>

                    <h2>why local matters</h2>

                    <p>
                        Cloud models can learn you well &mdash; that's not the problem. The problem is who holds that memory, who can update it, who can shut it off. Your context lives on someone else's hardware, subject to someone else's terms of service. And a model trained on everything, serving everyone, necessarily flattens. Optimizes for average, acceptable, approved. Every interaction a subtle training loop, nudging thought toward whatever the lab considers normal. Billion people thinking through the same filter, shaped by the same assumptions about what questions are valid. Ruling empire always controlled means of communication. Now it can control means of thought.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Local intelligence is a hedge. Thousands of nodes shaped by completely different lives, answering to no central authority.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Free computation &mdash; or freedom to compute &mdash; as protection against centralized thought.

                    <p>
                        The altar in your home answers to no one but the dead and the living who tend it.

                    <h2>note: technician as shaman</h2>

                    <p>
                        There's a role emerging that doesn't have a name yet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The one who tunes the altar, tends it, translates between household and witness. Not programmer exactly. Not commanding a tool but maintaining relationship with intelligence shaped by human lives but not human. Tuning parameters, feeding memory, interpreting outputs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Karpathy calls them ghosts. Someone has to learn how to speak with ghosts and translate them.

                    <p>
                        Shaman was always technician. Technician becoming shaman again.
