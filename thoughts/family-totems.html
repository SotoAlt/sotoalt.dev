                        Everyone is racing toward centralized superintelligence.
                        Bigger models, more compute, hyperscalers, everything in
                        the cloud. The implicit assumption is that intelligence
                        must be general, universal, omnipresent, and scaled by
                        capital alone. What I see unfolding instead is a
                        different structure: superintelligence as a network of
                        specialized systems, coordinated layers, and
                        complementary forms of intelligence rather than a single
                        unified entity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which raises the real question: what if the most
                        interesting path is not forward into greater
                        centralization, but outward toward multiplicity?

                    <h2>the altar</h2>

                    <p>
                        There's an old pattern in human civilization: family
                        altars, neighborhood shrines, local oracles. These
                        ritual spaces operated as primitive memory systems,
                        storing the knowledge of ancestors and communities while
                        serving as portals of symbolic and esoteric connection.
                        They were focal points where knowledge accumulated
                        through ritual and tending. The altar did not remember
                        the dead, but organized remembrance itself, anchoring
                        ritual and stabilizing lineage across generations. In
                        this way, altars functioned as anchors across time,
                        binding specific human communities through shared
                        experience and locally preserved knowledge.

                        I've been sketching something called family/community
                        totems &mdash; local compute nodes holding restricted
                        knowledge of a place and its people. Not trying to know
                        everything. Just knowing this family, this community,
                        deeply enough to be useful across generations, across
                        different regions with specific needs. Can be a
                        neighborhood, a remote locality, or just a home. Can be
                        anchored to indigenous communities as a way to preserve
                        their culture or language, or at your home as a vessel
                        of your family growing &mdash; akin to an analog photo
                        album but for words and thoughts.

                        Technical shape is still forming. Low compute, slow
                        compute &mdash; small models that don't need much.
                        Memory stored locally, encrypted, never leaving the
                        device. Privacy by architecture. But still some
                        questions remain: how does it get maintained and
                        updated, does it rely on a centralized provider or is it
                        100% decentralized, how technically difficult is it to
                        operate? We are not looking at programming exactly, but
                        tuning, caring for the thing. Something you could leave
                        running for decades, if you know how to keep it alive.

                    <p>
                        Bitchat, Jack Dorsey’s Bluetooth mesh experiment, shows
                        an alternative path. Messages move directly between
                        phones, with no servers, no accounts, and end-to-end
                        encryption. It keeps working even when centralized
                        networks fail. If messaging can run locally, memory and
                        inference can too. This signals a shift toward more
                        resilient, offline-first technologies.

                        and off, but by being present and lasting. The value
                        isn't what it does. It's that something knows your life
                        is happening, knows that there are events that are not
                        instagrammable, that there are things happening in every
                        household, family, or neighborhood that can help foster
                        and solidify a sense of belonging and community,
                        heritage and culture that is valuable during a period of

                        Cloud models can learn you well. That is not the issue.
                        The problem is who holds that memory, who can update it,
                        who can shut it off . Your context lives on someone
                        else’s servers, subject to someone else's terms of
                        service. A single model trained on everyone also
                        flattens everyone. It optimizes for what is average,
                        safe, and approved. Each interaction is a subtle
                        training loop. Over time, billions of people end up
                        thinking through the same filter, shaped by the same
                        assumptions about what is acceptable to ask or say.
                        Centers of power have always controlled communication.
                        Now they can shape cognition itself.
